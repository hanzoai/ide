# Tauri signs and notarizes automatically during `tauri build` when the right
# environment variables are present. Set these (do NOT commit them):
#
#   APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY  "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)"
#                           (list yours with: security find-identity -v -p codesigning)
#   APPLE_ID                your Apple ID email
#   APPLE_PASSWORD          an app-specific password from appleid.apple.com
#                           (NOT your normal password)
#   APPLE_TEAM_ID           your 10-character team id
#
# With APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY set, Tauri signs the .app with the hardened
# runtime + src-tauri/entitlements.plist. With the APPLE_* creds also set, it
# notarizes the bundle and staples the ticket, so the DMG opens cleanly on
# other Macs (no Gatekeeper "unidentified developer" block).
