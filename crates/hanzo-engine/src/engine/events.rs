// Hanzo Engine — Event types
//
// In legacy Hanzo AI this module dispatched inbound events (webhook,
// agent message) to the kanban-task system, which would auto-fire any
// task whose `event_trigger` JSON matched. Hanzo phase 1 deleted the
// tasks subsystem, so dispatch is now a no-op. The `EngineEvent` enum
// is retained because `tools::squads` and `tools::agent_comms` still
// emit AgentMessage events for inter-agent observability.
